RAxML-NG was called at 12-Mar-2019 13:12:45 as follows:

raxml-ng --all --msa alignment.fs --model F81 --prefix heylo --threads 4 --bs-trees 1000 --bs-metric fbp

Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search + bootstrapping (Felsenstein Bootstrap)
  start tree(s): random (10) + parsimony (10)
  bootstrap replicates: 1000
  random seed: 1552414365
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX
  parallelization: PTHREADS (4 threads), thread pinning: OFF

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (F81) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
