[00:00:00] Reading alignment from file: alignment.fs
[00:00:00] Loaded alignment with 20 taxa and 4482 sites

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 2114 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: F81+FO
Alignment sites / patterns: 4482 / 2114
Gaps: 6.81 %
Invariant sites: 1.18 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file already exists: yanoy.raxml.rba


WARNING: You might be using too many threads (10) for your alignment with 2114 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.
