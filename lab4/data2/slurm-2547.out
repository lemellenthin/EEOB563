Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search + bootstrapping (Felsenstein Bootstrap)
  start tree(s): random (10) + parsimony (10)
  bootstrap replicates: max: 1000 + bootstopping (autoMRE, cutoff: 0.030000)
  random seed: 1552357141
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX
  parallelization: PTHREADS (16 threads), thread pinning: OFF

[00:00:01] Reading alignment from file: alignment.fs
[00:00:01] Loaded alignment with 20 taxa and 4482 sites

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 2114 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: F81+FO
Alignment sites / patterns: 4482 / 2114
Gaps: 6.81 %
Invariant sites: 1.18 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file already exists: yay.raxml.rba


WARNING: You might be using too many threads (16) for your alignment with 2114 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.


ERROR: Too few patterns per thread! RAxML-NG will terminate now to avoid wasting resources.
NOTE:  Please reduce the number of threads (see guidelines above).
NOTE:  This check can be disabled with the '--force' option.
